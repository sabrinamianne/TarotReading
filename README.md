# Madame Codus's Tarot Reading

#### A simple three-card tarot reading

#### By **Marguerite Kennedy, Sabrina Mianne, Zema Kebede, Anna Gibbons**

## Description

Welcome to Madame Codus's parlor! The user will be asked to think of a situation that they are contemplating, e.g. "Should I take the next step in this relationship?" or "Should I continue on my current career track?"  


### Specs

UI -

The user will click on the card deck image on the landing page, which will randomly generate three tarot cards with corresponding messages for what that card may indicate about the given situation.
Use constructor functions to create a sample card that others will be a prototype of.

We will initially have a "deck" of 20 cards. Each will have an image and a message that goes with it.

Upon clicking, the initial image with the card deck will be hidden, and replaced by the card and message for "Past," "Present," and "Future" for each.

If time permits, we will create functionality for cards to be "turned over" upon clicking, and revealed one at a time instead of in a spread of three.

Select "cards" for images and size appropriately.
Create corresponding brief text for each card generated (e.g., "This indicates a time when you felt optimistic and powerful")


// BUSINESS LOGIC

Create an array with a deck of cards, based on a constructor that includes image and text properties. 

Create a randomizer that will output three cards in the following three positions: PAST, PRESENT and FUTURE.

For each of positions, output an IMAGE of a card, along with the corresponding information about that card.

As with a real deck, each card should occur only ONE time in each reading.
